# SecureSensorNode Project

## Overview
SecureSensorNode is an educational project developed for the Software Engineering course. It consists of a secure embedded client-server system, including an STM32-based client that collects sensor data securely and sends it via UART to a Python microservice.

## Directory structure

- `client`: Embedded STM32 software (HAL and bare-metal examples).
- `server`: Python microservice exposing RESTful APIs.
- `automation`: Automation scripts and simulated CI/CD pipelines.
- `test`: Unit and integration tests.
- `security`: Cryptography and security-related documentation/examples.
- `docs`: General project documentation (design diagrams, reports).
